    Horizontal scrolling could be enabled via <em>horizontal</em> setting. The styles also need to be fixed in
    accordance with horizontal scrolling. Currently we have some limitations at the template layer but
    <em>display: inline-block;</em> rule applied to all nested containers makes the horizontal mode work.
