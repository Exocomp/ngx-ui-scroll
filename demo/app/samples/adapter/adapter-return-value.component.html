      Each <em>Adapter</em> method runs the <em>uiScroll Workflow</em>
      that handles multiple internal processes, some of which may be asynchronous.
      In order to deal with such asynchronicity,
      the return value of the <em>Adapter</em> method is a <em>Promise</em>
      that is resolved when all internal processes
      triggered by the <em>Adapter</em> are terminated.
      Return value has following type
    </p>

    <pre>{{returnValueType}}</pre>

    <p>
      - <em>success</em>: specifies whether the <em>Adapter</em> method completed successfully or not;
      for example, if some method is invoked with wrong arguments, no error will be thrown,
      but we'll get <em>success:&nbsp;false</em> in the result;
      <br>
      - <em>error</em>: contains error message in case <em>success</em> is <em>false</em>;
      <br>
      - <em>immediate</em>: specifies whether the <em>Adapter</em> method completed immediately or not;
      for example, if <em>Adapter.remove</em> won't remove any items, then it will be
      terminated immediately and we'll get <em>immediate:&nbsp;true</em> in the result.
    </p>

    <pre>{{returnValueSample}}</pre>

    <p>
      Note, <em>immediate:&nbsp;false</em> does not necessarily mean that the <em>Adapter</em> method
      worked asynchronously. But, in most cases we'll have async processes,
      so it is highly recommended to pay special attention to logic that is going to be run
      after the <em>Adapter</em> method is invoked. Generally such logic needs to be
      postponed by waiting for the promisified result of the <em>Adapter</em> method invocation.
