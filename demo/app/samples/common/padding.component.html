    <p>
      Here the <em>Datasource.get</em> method implementation is taken from previous samples,
      but the <em>Settings</em> object is completed with <em>padding</em> property.
      This setting defines an extra space added to the visible part of the viewport for
      the purpose of determining when the items should be created/destroyed.
      The value is relative to the visible size of the viewport.
      So <em>1.46</em> means that the <em>uiScroll</em> would request new items
      until the areas of 146% of the viewport size on both of forward and backward directions
      are filled with rendered items: 100% + 146% downward and 146% upward.
      In this demo we have 3 requests on the initial load, let's see what happened:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>250px + 250px * 1.46 = 615px
        -- total size of area that needs to be filled on downward (positive) direction,
        where 250px is the size of the visible viewport (per CSS)
      </li>
      <li>7 items * 25px = 175px
        -- the result size of first downward fetch,
        where <em>bufferSize</em> is 7 and 25px is the item's size (per CSS)
      </li>
      <li>615px - 175px = 440px
        -- downward space which has to be filled during second downward fetch
      </li>
      <li>ceil(440px / 25px) = 18
        -- items number that is needed to feel remain 440px area during second downward fetch
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      So we have 2 <em>Datasource.get</em> downward requests for 7 and 18 items.
      To satisfy 40 DOM elements we need to fetch 40 - (7 + 18) = 15 more items.
      And this is an explanation of the last (initial backward) fetch:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>1.46 * 250px = 360px
        -- upward space which has to be filled on backward (negative) direction
      </li>
      <li>ceil(360px / 25px) = 15
        -- items number that is needed to feel 360px area on backward fetch
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The default value of <em>padding</em> property is 0.5. The minimum value is 0.1.
    </p>
  </div>
